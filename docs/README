=======================================================
Please read this file before attempting to generate the 
documentation associated with AMPLE.
=======================================================

In order to generate any form of the documentation, you
need to install certain requirements within your CCP4
installation.

These dependencies are not automatically shipped with
CCP4 and without those, you cannot generate the our any
format of the documentation.

Luckily, these are installed in just a few steps. Open
your command prompt or terminal and type the following:

$ ccp4-python -m pip install -r doc-requirements.txt

Then, you are ready to go. Generate the documentation 
from within the docs folder of AMPLE by using the 
following command:

$ make html

This will generate an HTML version of the documentation, 
which you can view by openening the _build/html/index.html 
file.

-------------------------------------------------------

If you want to re-generate the API documentation, run
the following command prior to running ``make html``:

$ sphinx-apidoc -e -f -l -M -o api/generated ../ample ../ample/*/tests
