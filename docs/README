=======================================================
Please read this file before attempting to generate the 
documentation associated with AMPLE.
=======================================================

In order to generate any form of the documentation, you
need to install certain requirements within your CCP4
installation.

These dependencies are not automatically shipped with
CCP4 and without those, you cannot generate the our any
format of the documentation.

The dependencies you require are:
    - Sphinx 
        http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/index.html
    - Sphinx Autobuild
        https://pypi.python.org/pypi/sphinx-autobuild
    - Sphinx ReadTheDocs Theme
        https://pypi.python.org/pypi/sphinx_rtd_theme

Luckily, these are installed in just a few steps. Open
your command prompt or terminal and type the following:

$ ccp4-python -m pip install sphinx sphinx-autobuild sphinx_rtd_theme sphinxcontrib-napoleon 

Then, you are ready to go. Generate the documentation from
within the docs folder of AMPLE by using the following command:

$ ccp4-python -m sphinx -b html . _build/html

This will generate an HTML version of the documentation, 
which you can view by openening the _build/html/index.html file.
