Requirements: 
needs some 3rd party software:
LGA 
Maxcluster
Rosetta
Theseus
SQWRL

Known Issues:
1)The output names of the Rosetta files are hard coded, if the Rosetta naming conventions change this needs to be updated. 
2)assumes that the number of models to make is > number of processors 
3)crash handling by making models in different dirs, can rerun the job and Rosetta will continue from where it stopped. But if the folders are already full of models, Rosetta will hang.
4)Theseus is also known to hang (will be caught and rerun until success)
5)Rosetta cluster can fail (will be caught and rerun until success)
6)Assumes paths are correct, checks for pathways to be added
7) needs a long command line (a problem with theseus)
8)shelx will infiniate loop if space group is P -1 (to add a check for this)


In the release version:
models can be directly input (eg from QUARK or custom Rosetta)
